# CRAGE-RB-PI-seq
CRAGE randomly barcoded promoter-library insertion sequencing (CRAGE-RB-PI-seq) is a method to characterize the promoter activities of host-colonizing bacteria. This selectively amplifies barcoded transcripts, overcoming interference from host RNA. As a proof of concept, we analyzed the transcriptional activities of Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 during Arabidopsis root colonization.
